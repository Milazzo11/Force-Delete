A program to forcibly close windows folders and files.
Programs running in files will be forcibly killed, and the folder will be deleted.

The program seems to be very reliable, but if there is a problem, trying running it again.
Note that Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers will be closed to best ensure that no programs are running during the attempted deletion.

Run the INSTALL.exe file in the "Installer" folder, making sure the program is downloaded into "C:\Program Files" or it will not work.


Enjoy :)
