A program that adds extra "right click" folder and file options for Windows.

What it can do:
- Force delete files/folders (with running tasks)
- Force kill tasks
- Block connection of files/folders with firewall
- Allow connection of files/folders through firewall

Note:
- With the force deletion program, Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers will be closed to better ensure deletion.
- If there is still a deletion problem, restart your computer and try again.
- The force deletion programs take about 3 seconds to execute.
- Firewall blocker programs require administrative permission when used.

Run the INSTALL.exe file in the "Installer" folder, making sure the program is downloaded into "C:\Program Files" or it will not work.

Enjoy :)
